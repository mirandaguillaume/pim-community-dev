# Illustrations

Illustrations are visually and emotionally powerful tools. Carefully identify the correct illustration in accordance with the content. If an illustration is used only as a decorative element, it can lose communication power and distract people. Use illustrations to encourage users who are frustrated, lost or have problems. For example, a page without results.
