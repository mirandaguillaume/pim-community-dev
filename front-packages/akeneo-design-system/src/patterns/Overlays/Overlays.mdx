### Dismissal

**The overlay may be dismissed in 3 ways:**

- Using the "X" button on the top left corner of the overlay
- Pressing the ESC key
- Validating or canceling the main action

## Design properties

Overlays are composed of distinct areas: a header, the body, and sometimes an illustration. There are two separate layouts, which we can use as needed. For example, for the data table, we use the full-width overlay, and for product deletion, we use the split overlay with an illustration on the left.

### Fullscreen Overlay

<Canvas of={Stories.FullscreenOverlay} />

### Split screen Overlay

<Canvas of={Stories.SplitScreenOverlay} />
