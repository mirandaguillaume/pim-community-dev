# Collapse

## Usage

The collapse is used to organise groups of elements and hide them when the user consider that is unecessary information.

To inform the user when there are changes or choices inside the collapse, there can be a Badge with the number of changes or a Pill component.

## Interaction

By default, the collapse is closed, the user has to click on the "plus icon" to open the collapse.

Two possible behaviours, automaticaly close collapse when you open another one or keep all states (open or close).

## Playground

<Canvas of={Stories.Standard} />

<ArgTypes of={Stories.Standard} />

## With Pill

<Canvas of={Stories.WithPill} />

## With Badge

Here you can add/remove content in the Collapse component to see that it adapts its height accordingly.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithBadge} />

## With content

The Collapse can also be set to be opened by default, like here.

<Canvas of={Stories.WithContent} />
