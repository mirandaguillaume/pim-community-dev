# Progress bar

## Usage
One of the most important rules in UI / UX design is visibility of system state. The goal behind this rule is pretty obvious: To minimize user stress, you need to provide them with feedback on what is going on with the app within a reasonable amount of time. Don't let users guess, tell them what's going on. And one of the most common forms of this type of feedback is a progress indicator.

### Types of Progress bars
**Determinate:** when indicators are determinate they indicate how long an operation will take when the percentage complete is detectable.

**Indeterminate**: when indicators are indeterminate they request that the user waits while something finishes when it’s not necessary to indicate how long it will take.
