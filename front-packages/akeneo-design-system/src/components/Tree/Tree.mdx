# Tree

## Usage

A tree is a hierarchical component that displays the visual representation of the parent-child relationship between nodes (such as categories, families, etc...). There are different variations that allow to select only one and/or multiple node at the same time.

## General guidance

Tree structures are flexible. A default tree provides a structure with named nodes and arrows to expand/collapse child nodes, whereas a selectable tree features checkboxes allowing the user to select nodes and/or children nodes.

## Technical note

The Tree component uses its value to trigger onOpen, onClose and other events. By default, the value is typehinted as a string. You can set a different type by using generic type `<Tree<number> {...}/>` for example.
