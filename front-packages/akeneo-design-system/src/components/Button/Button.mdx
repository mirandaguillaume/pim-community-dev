# Button

## Usage

Buttons express what action will occur when the users clicks. Buttons are used to initialize an action, either in the background or foreground of an experience.

### General guidance

Buttons are used primarily on action items. Some examples include Add, Save, Delete, and Sign up. Each page can have one or two primary buttons. Any remaining calls-to-action should be represented as secondary buttons.

Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links to take the users to a new page.

### Labels

Button labels should clearly indicate the action of the button. Use active verbs, such as Add or Delete. Use no more than three words for button labels.

For sets of buttons, use specific labels, such as Save or Discard, instead of using OK and Cancel. This is particularly helpful when the user is confirming an action.

### IconButton

If you only need to display an Icon as your button, check out the <LinkTo kind="Components/Buttons/IconButton" story="Standard">IconButton component</LinkTo>.

## Playground

Use this playground to test the button component

<Canvas of={Stories.Standard} />

<ArgTypes of={Stories.Standard} />

## Variation on level

<Canvas of={Stories.Level} />

## Variation on ghost

<Canvas of={Stories.Ghost} />

## Variation on active

<Canvas of={Stories.Active} />

## Variation on disabled

<Canvas of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Variation on size

<Canvas of={Stories.Size} />

## Usage with `href` prop

If you want your button to act like a <LinkTo kind="Components/Link" story="Standard">Link</LinkTo> (with "open in a new tab" feature of cmd/ctrl + click), use the `href` prop to specify your link.

<Canvas of={Stories.Link} />

## With an Icon

<Canvas of={Stories.WithAnIcon} />
