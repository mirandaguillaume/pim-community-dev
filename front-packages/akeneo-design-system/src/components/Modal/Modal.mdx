# Modal

## Usage

The Modal Component is the main Component of the Overlay pattern and is used to display a secondary window over the content.
It can be used with or without an Illustration and adapts its content accordingly.

## Playground

<Canvas of={Stories.Standard} />

<ArgTypes of={Stories.Standard} />

## Variation with Illustration

<Canvas of={Stories.WithIllustration} />

## Usage with Composition

The Modal Component also exposes a `BottomButtons` Component that is helpful to display Buttons at the bottom of the Modal children. It can be used as simply as this:

```jsx
<Modal {...props}>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
  <Modal.BottomButtons>
    <Button>Cancel</Button>
    <Button>Confirm</Button>
  </Modal.BottomButtons>
</Modal>
```

A few examples of usage of the `Modal` Component can be found on the <LinkTo kind="Patterns/Overlays" story="Confirm Modal">Overlays story.</LinkTo>
