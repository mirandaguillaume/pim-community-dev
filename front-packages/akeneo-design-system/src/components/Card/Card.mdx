# Card

## Usage

Cards are used to have a good visual representation of the items to display. Cards can be used in a grid or in a collection.
_Example: Assets manager or Connections._

Cards should be displayed in a grid, therefore, a `CardGrid` component is also available with a convenient `size` prop. Possible values for the `size` prop are: `normal` or `big`.

## Playground

<Canvas of={Stories.Standard} />

<ArgTypes of={Stories.Standard} />

## Selectable

<Canvas of={Stories.Selectable} />

## With Badges

<Canvas of={Stories.WithBadges} />

## With Links

<Canvas of={Stories.WithLinks} />

## CardGrid

Here the `fit` prop is also set to `contain`.

<Canvas of={Stories.CardGrid} />

## Big CardGrid

<Canvas of={Stories.Size} />

## Small Stack Cards

<Canvas of={Stories.SmallStackedCard} />

## Big Stack Cards

<Canvas of={Stories.BigStackedCard} />
